Summary of\
BOLESKINE's book:\
"I met a 12-year-\
old boy willing to guide\
me through the forest.\
What a sight... The stars\
appear to be a rifle\
shot away. He held the\
torches while I drew new\
constellations.\
I named them\
OCTOPUS, STALKER..."\
Who was the boy?\
There must be a\
register of births\
for that period.\
Where can I find\
the town records?
